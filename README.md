Chipshop Finance is an ambitious experimental economy project on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The aim of this project is to become the longest lasting and most successful stablecoin on the BSC, learning from the mistakes of others which went under-pegged. It is a fork of Wantan Mee, a lightweight implementation of the [Basis Protocol](basis.io) on Ethereum.

## History of Basis

Basis is an algorithmic stablecoin protocol where the money supply is dynamically adjusted to meet changes in money demand.  

- When demand is rising, the blockchain will create more tokens. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Basis price back down.
- When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back tokens. The contracted supply is designed to restore Basis price.
- The Basis protocol is designed to expand and contract supply similarly to the way central banks buy and sell fiscal debt to stabilize purchasing power. For this reason, we refer to ChipShop as having an algorithmic central bank.

Read the [Basis Whitepaper](http://basis.io/basis_whitepaper_en.pdf) for more details into the protocol. 

Basis was shut down in 2018, due to regulatory concerns its Bond and Share tokens have security characteristics. 

## The ChipShop Protocol

ChipShop differs from the original Basis Project in several meaningful ways which are fully described in the [documentation](https://chipshop-finance.gitbook.io/chipshop-finance/)


## Conclusion

ChipShop is an example of us being strong supporters of algorithmic stablecoins in particular and DeFi in general. However, it is an experiment and participants should take great caution and learn more about the seigniorage concept to avoid any potential loss.
